# Mask Hooks

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife and I bought several washable, reusable face masks for ourselves and our children. However it's not a good idea to put them through the dryer since they have elastic material that will get damaged by the heated dry. So I set out to design a hook for hanging the masks to dry.

Looking around my unfinished laundry room, I settled on hanging them from mask hooks that are custom designed to clip onto the 1/2-inch cold water copper piping between the ceiling truss above, and my mask hook design is the result.

This is my first 100% custom design. I created it from scratch and put it through a number of test prints to find the length and design that was ideal for us. I've included each iteration of the design within this repository. Each is viable, but the final version (2.2) is the one that meets our needs specifically.

This design is also available on [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-132291).
