# WyzeShoe DSLR Hot Shoe Mount for WyzeCam

When I shoot my hyperlapse videos I like to be able to keep an eye on the printing progress via a WyzeCam. But I didn't want the WyzeCam to appear in the DSLR photos, nor did I want to have to use more floor space with another stand. So I quickly remixed and mashed a couple projects together to create a WyzeCam Hot Shoe Mount. Now, my WyzeCam is affixed to the flash mount on my DSLR, giving me a good view of the print in progress.

The WyzeShoe allows the WyzeCam magnetic plate to simply snap in, which gives the WyzeCam extra support and ensures it is stable.

This design is also available on [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-141392).

## Versions

- **1.2** - hot shoe mount is at center of gravity to provide optimum stability. Will most assuredly block built-in flash.
- **1.1** - hot shoe mounted at front of the WyzeShoe in an effort to get out of the way of the flash. However, the built-in flash still can't quite extend on my D5100. Since I strongly recommend against using flash when shooting hyperlapse/timelapse, and since that is the main point of this product, I will lean toward stability rather than ability to use flash. Keep in mind if you absolutely need to use the flash, you can buy (or print?) hot shoe braces which extend the flash hot shoe.

## Disclaimer

The name "WyzeShoe" is simply short for WyzeCam Hot Shoe. I am not affiliated with Wyze... or Nike. Since Wyze has been bringing out all kinds of new products, I imagine when they inevitably start making shoes, I'll need to change the name  :D
