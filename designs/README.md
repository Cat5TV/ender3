# Robbie's 3D Printer Designs for Ender-3 V2

As part of our series on 3D printing with the Ender-3 V2, Robbie has included his STL and GCODE files for you to print yourself.

**Please Note:** The GCODE files are laid out specifically for the Ender-3 V2 and may have problems on other printers. Therefore, if you are using a different printer, please slice it yourself using the included STL files.
