# Small Spool Holder for Ender-3 V2

**This design uses the stock Ender-3 V2 nut, providing a smaller spool holder for 250G spools.**

I wanted to be able to get several colors in a single order of filament, so I opted for 250G spools in a 4-pack, which costs the same as a single 1KG spool. https://amzn.to/35Jgnc2

However, the spools don't fit on the stock Ender-3 V2 spool holder--the hole is too small. If only I had a 3D printer. WAIT - I do, *I do have a 3D printer*. So I picked up a cheap 1KG spool (which fits the stock spool holder), designed and printed a custom spool holder just for these little baby spools.

I've also created an optional nut for the Ender-3 V2 in case you've lost or broken the original.

This design is also available on [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-139585).

## Attribution

I started with vikke_01's Thing 3334367 as my starting point, but reworked it to my specs and used the stock nut from jaft64, Thing 3867019.

The "Z" on the spool holder is my son Zech's initial, because it's for him I made this (he wanted to be able to print with the 250G blue filament, but couldn't until I came up with a solution).
